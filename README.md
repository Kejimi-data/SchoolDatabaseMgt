# Secondary School Data Transformation Project

This project aims to transform the data footprint of a Secondary School while testing skills in creating and setting up a database, altering tables, manipulating data, and performing data retrieval and aggregation tasks. The database contains several tables that store information about students, classes, subjects, and grades.

## Features

- Creation and setup of a SQL Server database schema for a secondary school
- Population of tables with data related to students, classes, subjects, and grades
- Data manipulation tasks such as updating records, adding new entries, and deleting obsolete data
- Data retrieval and aggregation operations to generate reports, statistics, and insights about the school's performance

## Installation

1. Install SQL Server if you haven't already. You can download it from [Microsoft's website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).

2. Create a new database in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any other SQL Server management tool.

3. Execute the provided SQL scripts to create the necessary tables and populate them with sample data.

## Usage

To use the Secondary School Data Transformation Project, follow these instructions:

1. Open SSMS or your preferred SQL Server management tool.

2. Connect to the SQL Server instance where you created the database for this project.

3. Use SQL queries to perform various data transformation tasks, such as updating student records, calculating grades, or generating reports.
